** Data
DEADLINE: <2017-05-14 Sun>
- Insert Item data
- Insert Hero data
- Insert Ability data
** Analysis
*** Cluster
**** Team compositions as a whole (there are 5 different roles in the game referred to positions 1-5)
DEADLINE: <2017-05-21 Sun>
- Query all team compositions
- Cluster analysis
**** The metagame, i.e. what heroes are good/popular in the state of the game during certain time periods
DEADLINE: <2017-05-28 Sun>
- Find Patch dates
- Query all team compositions based on those dates
- Cluster analysis
**** During larger tournaments the metagame changes as the days go by since teams learn what works good/bad
DEADLINE: <2017-05-28 Sun>
- Decide on tournament
- Query all team compositions based on day
- Cluster analysis
*** Association
**** If enemy pick hero A, what should my team pick to counteract that hero (hero counters)
DEADLINE: <2017-05-21 Sun>
- Query all team compositions
- Association analysis
**** If my team pick hero A, what should my team pick that makes that hero even stronger (hero synergy)
