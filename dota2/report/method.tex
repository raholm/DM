\section*{\centering Method}

As esports is a rather new phenomenon, there have not been much analyses around it in the literature. However, some research have been made in DOTA 2 such as a recommendation engine for picks based on machine learning by Conley and Perry \cite{conley2013does}. Summerville et al. \cite{cook2016draft} have used machine learning to predict picks in the draft phase. In this report it is more of interest to explore patterns in the draft using data mining techniques rather than machine learning which is lacking in the literature.

\subsection*{Dataset}

DOTABUFF\footnote{https://www.dotabuff.com/} is a website that contain detailed information and statistics about both competitive and casual matches. The dataset used in this article consists of all the matches from all the Valve major events until \today and all the Internationals from 2012 stored by DOTABUFF. That covers 3028 matches in total.

\subsection*{Evaluation}

To evaluate the results from the analyses they have to be analyzed by either players, analysts, or enthusiasts that have a fairly good understanding of the game and the heroes in particular. I decided upon using qualitative analysis based on my own knowledge gained by watching a lot of professional games over the years and therefore heard professional game analysts' opinions about the game.
