\section*{\centering Conclusion}

In this paper I have used data mining techniques to find patterns in the drafting phase of DOTA 2 in professional matches by looking at the team compositions.

\subsection*{Future Work}

To further improve the evaluation of the techniques used in the analyses is to make it possible for the community to rate it by an online interface. That way it would be possible to gain feedback from people with various degree of knowledge about the game to determine if the results are useful to the targeted demographic.
