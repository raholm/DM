\section*{\centering Result}

In this section I will present the analyses that were done. One part consisted of using association analysis and the other part used cluster analysis. I will start of presenting the association analysis followed by the cluster analysis.

\subsection*{Association Analysis}

In the introduction I asked two questions about hero picks, when to pick certain hero and with what other heroes, and to investigate those questions I decided upon using association analysis with the FP-Growth algorithm. The analyses are presented below.

\subsubsection*{When should I pick hero X?}

As mentioned in the method, the focus was on Anti-Mage and Clinkz and tables \ref{tab:ass_antimage} and \ref{tab:ass_clinkz} show the respective rules that were found.

\begin{table}[H]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{ | c | c | }
    \hline
    antecedent & consequent \\ \hline
    Razor & Rubick \\ \hline
    Ember Spirit & Dark Seer \\ \hline
    Sand King & Rubick \\ \hline
    Naga Siren & Dark Seer  \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Association rules by FP-Growth algorithm of 153 team compositions against 4th or 5th pick Anti-Mage. The parameters were set to minimum support of 5 and minimum confidence of 0.4.}
  \label{tab:ass_antimage}
\end{table}


\begin{table}[H]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{ | c | c | }
    \hline
    antecedent & consequent \\ \hline
    Dark Seer & Juggernaut \\ \hline
    Gyrocopter & Earthshaker \\ \hline
    Tiny & Io \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Association rules by FP-Growth algorithm of 180 team compositions against 4th or 5th pick Clinkz. The parameters were set to minimum support of 5 and minimum confidence of 0.5.}
  \label{tab:ass_clinkz}
\end{table}

\subsubsection*{Which hero(es) should I pick along X?}

The rules selected contained either Io or Magnus in either the antecedent or consequent. Table \ref{tab:ass_io} shows the rules found for Io by FP-Growth

\begin{table}[H]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{ | c | c | }
    \hline
    Antecedent & Consequent \\ \hline
    Earthshaker, Tiny & Io \\ \hline
    Tiny, Beastmaster & Io \\ \hline
    Tiny, Rubick & Io \\ \hline
    Earthshaker, Io & Tiny  \\ \hline
    Tiny, Queen of Pain & Io \\ \hline
    Tiny, Batrider & Io \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Association rules containing Io by FP-Growth algorithm of 6028 team compositions. The parameters were set to minimum support of 10 and minimum confidence of 0.5.}
  \label{tab:ass_io}
\end{table}
and table \ref{tab:ass_magnus} contains the rules that include Magnus.

\begin{table}[H]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{ | c | c | }
    \hline
    Antecedent & Consequent \\ \hline
    Vengeful Spirit, Magnus & Juggernaut \\ \hline
    Templar Assassin, Magnus & Juggernaut \\ \hline
    Silencer, Magnus & Juggernaut \\ \hline
    Witch Doctor, Magnus & Juggernaut  \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Association rules containing Magnus by FP-Growth algorithm of 6028 team compositions. The parameters were set to minimum support of 5 and minimum confidence of 0.5.}
  \label{tab:ass_magnus}
\end{table}

\subsection*{Cluster Analysis}

In this section I will present the two different cluster analysis that have been conducted. The presented results are manually selected and only partial. The complete set of clusters can be found in the appendix at the end of the report. The analyses have utilized \textit{k}-modes and ROCK algorithms and follow the questions in the introduction, \textit{What are common team compositions overall?} and \textit{Do team compositions change between tournaments?}, and they are described below.

Note that the tables contain numbers beside the hero names and those correspond to the frequency of the particular hero in the cluster.

\subsubsection*{Hero Combinations}

Some of the hero combinations found by \textit{k}-modes are found in tables \ref{tab:cl_all_kmodes} and \ref{tab:cl_all_kmodes_mod}

\subsubsection*{Evolution of the Metagame}

Part of the results can be seen in tables \ref{tab:cl_shanghai_rock} and \ref{tab:cl_manila_rock}. The clusters were found by ROCK from the Shanghai and Manila Majors respectively.
