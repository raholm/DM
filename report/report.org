* \textit{k}-Means
In this exercise I have used the default options for the \textit{k}-means algorithm unless specified otherwise.

I have decided to use two settings, 2 and 5 clusters.

** Result 1
In the first clustering I decided the use the features: Energy, Protein, Fat.
The decision was based on the scatterplot matrix where I could see that there seemed to be positive correlations between protein/fat and energy.

*** 2 Clusters
The resulting clusters can be seen below.

#+ATTR_LATEX: :placement [H] :width 0.5\textwidth

We can see from the plots that the clusters seem good and are well separated.
The observations in the blue cluster have greater values in energy and fat with kind of an average value in protein.

*** 5 Clusters
The resulting clusters can be seen below.

The clusters seem reasonable except the green and the bright blue in the middle are not as well defined as they could be.
The two green observations close to the blue cluster could be considered part of the blue cluster and I think that would have been better cluster assignments.

However, this plot shows that the clusters are not as well defined as they first seemed. We can see that the green, red, and bright blue clusters overlap.

** Result 2
Here I decided the use the remaining features: iron, calium.

*** 2 Clusters
#+CAPTION: X-axis: Calcium, Y-axis: Iron
#+ATTR_LATEX: :placement [H] :width 0.5\textwidth
[[./images/cl2_res2_01.png]]

The clusters are not as well separated in this case since the observations are more scattared. It looks like it is suitable to find more than 2 clusters in this case.
*** 5 Clusters
#+CAPTION: X-axis: Calcium, Y-axis: Iron
#+ATTR_LATEX: :placement [H] :width 0.5\textwidth
[[./images/cl5_res2_01.png]]

Using 5 clusters yield much better clusters with higher separation and lower intra-cluster distances.
The within cluster sum of squared errors for 2 clusters was 2.1318825152549974 and for 5 clusters it was 0.20051454992067588 so we can see that it has
been reduced by 10.
** Seed
Since I am using random initialization the seed controls where the centroids are initialized which have great influence what the final clusters will look like.
