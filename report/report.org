* \textit{k}-Means
** Result 1
In this cluster analysis I decided to use the features: Energy, Protein, Fat.
The decision was based on the scatterplot matrix where I could see that there seemed to be positive correlations between protein/fat and energy.

*** 2 Clusters
The resulting clusters can be seen below.

We can see from the plots that the clusters seem good and are well separated.
The observations in the blue cluster have greater values in energy and fat with kind of an average value in protein.
We could say that the blue cluster contains energy rich and healthy food that are good when working out
while the red cluster contains food that are low-fat and low-energy that are good for weight loss.
